	<h1>Time, Space, Complexity</h1>
	<p>What is Time Complexity? It is a way to measure how long an algorithm takes to finish based on how big the input is. It helps us understand how efficient an algorithm is and how its performance changes as the input size grows.</p>
	<p><b>Space complexity</b> is a measure of the amount of memory an algorithm uses relative to the size of the input. It accounts for both the memory required by the variables in the program and the additional memory needed for the algorithm to execute.</p>
